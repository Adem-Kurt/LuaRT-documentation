## Types of Contributions

There are lots of ways to contribute to the Astro Docs website! 

The LuaRT documentation is available as a website. 
Contributing involves not only writing content, but also maintaining HTML, Javascript, and CSS code.

We encourage you to:

- **Report an Issue** to let us know of outdated, confusing, or incorrect documentation. You can also let us know of any problems you encounter on the site itself.

- **Make a PR directly** for very obvious documentation fixes like typos or broken links.

- **Look at our Existing Issues** especially those labelled [`help wanted`](https://github.com/samyeyo/LuaRT-documentation/issues?q=is:open+is:issue+label:%22help+wanted%22).
- **Review Existing PRs** (especially translations!) to help us get our fixes implemented live on the website sooner.

### Examples of Helpful GitHub New Issues

It would be helpful if you report :

- Typos
- A missing, outdated content
- An explanation that seems confusing
- An incorrect code example

### Writing an Issue

When reporting an issue, please :
- Use clear descriptive titles
- Provide links to relevant pages/files
- Give explanations concerning the reported issue
- Propose any potential solution you are thinking of

Contributions to the documentation site are made by editing the repository.
You can do this directly on GitHub or by creating a copy of the repository locally, making your changes there, and contributing back to our repository.
